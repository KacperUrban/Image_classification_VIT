# Image_classification_VIT
# General info
In this repository I will use different pretrained Vision Transfomers to classifies different buildings and places in Rzesz√≥w. 
# Dataset
The Beautiful Rzeszow dataset consists of 3000 images of 50 tourist sites in Rzeszow, Poland. Each attraction, such as a building, monument, or place, was photographed at a different time of the day (day and night) and season (spring, autumn, and winter). In the dataset, there are large scale, viewpoint and rotation variations, as well as challenging illumination conditions. All with a variety of occlusions.
# Status
The project is on going.
